# PerfectoActions

  PerfectoActions can execute device operations like clean up, reboot and get network settings in parallel across all/ specific perfecto devices and showcase their results in a fully responsive, accessibility friendly, html report which has direct access to open an available device, search for devices in the displayed html table, show case direct API results for clean & restart commands, raise a perfecto support ticket, open your perfecto cloud, nagivate to perfecto documentation and showcases device status, model, OS versions & SIM operator graphs.

## Recommended system configuration:
    
    1. 8 GB Ram and above
    
    2. 2.20 GHz multi core processors and above
    

## Prerequisites:
    
  1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3+ and make sure that python version > 3+ is set as default.
    
  2. Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
    
  3. Run the following command from command prompt/ terminal:
  
           pip3 install perfectoactions -U
    
## Usage:

    perfectoactions [-h] [-c cloud_name] [-s security_token]
                       [-d [device_list_parameters]]
                       [-t [Different types of Device Connection status]]
                       [-a [actions]] [-r [refresh]] [-o [output in html]]
                       

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c cloud_name, --cloud_name cloud_name
                            Perfecto cloud name. (E.g. demo)
      -s security_token, --security_token security_token
                            Perfecto Security Token/ Pass your Perfecto's username/email
                            and password in user:password format
      -d [device_list_parameters], --device_list_parameters [device_list_parameters]
                            Perfecto get device list API parameters to limit
                            device list. Support all API capabilities which
                            selects devices based on reg ex/strings, Leave it
                            empty to select all devices
      -t [Different types of Device Connection status], --device_status [Different types of Device Connection status]
                            Different types of Device Connection status. Values:
                            all. This will showcase all the device status like
                            Available, Disconnected, un-available & Busy. Note:
                            Only Available devices will be shown by default
      -a [actions], --actions [actions]
                            Perfecto actions seperated by semi-colon. E.g.
                            reboot:true;cleanup:true;get_network_settings:true
      -r [refresh], --refresh [refresh]
                            Refreshes the page with latest device status as per
                            provided interval in seconds
      -o [output in html], --output [output in html]
                            output in html. Values: true/false. Default is true
                        
                        
## Examples:

1. List all available devices: <br />
 
    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>"`
    

2. List all available devices using perfecto username and password: <br />
 
    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<username/email>>:<<password>>"`
    

3. List all devices irrespective on device status: <br />
 
    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -t all`
    

4. Reboot, clean up and get network settings for all devices in parallel: <br />
 
    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -t "all" -a "reboot:true;cleanup:true;get_network_settings:true"`
    

5.  get network settings like airplane mode, wifi and data for only available galaxy devices in parallel: <br />
 
    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>"  -a "get_network_settings:true" -d "model:Galaxy.*"`

6. Re-runs the same execution with a specified sleep time: <br />
 
    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -r 1`
    

7. Skip's output in html format: ( for faster results in terminal/cmd ) <br />
 
    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -o false`
    

### Note:

    1. Make sure active scripting is enabled in IE browser.
    2. Preferred browsers are Chrome and Safari.
    3. Kindly use python version 3 and above.

## Experimental proxy: ( Yet to be tested )
    
    Configure proxies by setting environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY. E.g. in mac:

        export HTTP_PROXY="10.10.1.10:3128"
        export HTTPS_PROXY="10.10.1.10:1080"
    
    To use HTTPS Basic Auth with your proxy, try this: https://user:password@host:port

        export HTTP_PROXY="https://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/"
        export HTTPS_PROXY="https://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/"
    
    Note: avoid using special characters such as :,@ in username and passwords

    10. WINDOWS:
        Add a build step: Execute Windows batch command and add the below commands inside it:
        
            pip install -U perfectoactions
            del /s /q "C:\Users\<<Windows user name>>\AppData\Local\Temp\output\*.*"
            perfectoactions -c <<CLOUD NAME, e.g. demo>>  -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" <<ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS AS APPLICABLE>>
            xcopy /s "C:\Users\<<Windows user name>>\AppData\Local\Temp\output" .
            EXIT /B
<img src="https://github.com/PerfectoMobileSA/Device_actions_reporter/blob/master/docs/jenkins/2.png" height="360" width="760"/>        
   
        MAC:
        Add a build step: Execute shell and add the below commands inside it:
            <<PATH TO PIP>>/pip3 install -U perfectoactions
            rm -rf "/tmp/output/*.*"
            perfectoactions -c <<CLOUD NAME, e.g. demo>> -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" <<ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS AS APPLICABLE>>
            cp /tmp/output/result.html .

    Note: 
       1. Update preferred values within <<>> as applicable
       2. Use which command in terminal to find path of pip3/perfectoactions. E.g. "which pip3" will show the path of pip3.
       
    11. Add post-build Actions: Archive the artifacts with files to archive: result.html (Screenshots above)
    12. Add post-build Actions: Publish HTML reports with index page: result.html (Screenshots above)
    13. Run the job to find the results.html being published as a html report.
